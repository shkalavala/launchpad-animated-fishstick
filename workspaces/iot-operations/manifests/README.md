# manifests/

Standalone manifests and their internal partials for the AIO platform.

## Files

| File | Kind | Deployable | Purpose |
|------|------|------------|---------|
| `aio-install.yaml` | Standalone | yes | Day-1 AIO platform install. Composes `_aio-fundamentals.yaml` and conditionally adds secret sync. |
| `aio-upgrade.yaml` | Standalone | yes | In-place AIO upgrade to the site's current `aioRelease`. |
| `secretsync.yaml` | Standalone | yes | Day-2 enable secret sync on an existing AIO install. |
| `_aio-fundamentals.yaml` | Partial | no | Arc extensions, custom location, instance, schema registry, ADR namespace, plus optional global/edge sites. |
| `_resolve-aio.yaml` | Partial | no | Reads instance and custom-location names from the existing AIO instance for downstream chaining. |
| `_secretsync.yaml` | Partial | no | Workload-identity-backed secret sync step. |

## Conventions

- **`_` prefix** marks an internal partial. Not deployed directly. Composed via `include:`. The `test_partial_files_use_underscore_prefix` workspace test enforces this (a manifest authored to be included must start with `_`).
- **Standalone manifests** are convenience entry points for `siteops deploy`. They re-include the partials they depend on.
- **Composed manifests live in `samples/<name>/manifest.yaml`**, next to the partials they compose. A composition that pulls in two standalone manifests will collide on shared step names (e.g. `resolve-aio`). Compose the underlying `_partial.yaml` files instead. See `samples/README.md` for the full composition rules.

## Authoring a new partial

1. Name the file `_<topic>.yaml` (leading underscore).
2. Set `kind: Manifest`. The engine has no separate Partial kind.
3. Include only the steps that ARE the topic. Do not pull prerequisites. The parent decides ordering.
4. If the partial needs values from upstream steps, reference them as `{{ steps.<name>.outputs.<key> }}` and document the expected upstream step in the description.

See `docs/manifest-includes.md` for the full include contract.
