# Digital Operations Scale Kit

**Fleet-scale Azure infrastructure deployment.**

> [!NOTE]
> This project is under active development. If you're an Azure IoT Operations customer or interested in fleet-scale deployment, reach out at <azureiotoperationslicensinghelp@microsoft.com>.

Deploy Azure IoT Operations, or any Azure infrastructure, across dozens of sites with a single command. Per-site customization, parallel execution, and failure isolation built in.

```bash
# Deploy to all production sites
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations deploy manifests/aio-install.yaml -l "environment=prod"
```

## What's in this repository

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Site Ops** | A reference implementation of a multi-site IaC orchestration tool. Template-agnostic. Works with any Bicep or ARM templates. |
| **IoT Operations Workspace** | A starter kit demonstrating Site Ops for deploying Azure IoT Operations at scale. |

---

## Why Site Ops?

ARM/Bicep deploys resources. Site Ops orchestrates deployments across your fleet.

> **Site Ops isn't replacing ARM/Bicep. It's the fleet management layer on top.**

| Challenge | Site Ops Solution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Deploying to 50+ sites manually | One command deploys to all matching sites in parallel |
| Targeting specific sites or environments | Label-based selection filters your fleet (`-l environment=prod`, `-l country=US`) |
| Per-site configuration differences | Template variables (`{{ site.name }}`, `{{ site.labels.X }}`) customize each deployment |
| Multi-step dependencies | Output chaining passes resource IDs between steps automatically |
| Partial failures stopping everything | Failure isolation. One site's failure doesn't block others |
| Environment-specific values mixed with code | Site overlays separate per-environment config from committed files |

### Portability

Site Ops runs anywhere Python runs. No agents, no servers, no state to manage.

- **Run anywhere**: local machine, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, or any CI/CD platform
- **Zero infrastructure**: no servers, agents, or state backends to provision
- **CI/CD agnostic**: included GitHub Actions workflows serve as reference implementations. Adapt to your preferred platform.

### Key capabilities

- **One-command fleet deployment**: deploy to all matching sites with a single command
- **Declarative site inventory**: define your fleet as code. Sites have labels, parameters, and inheritance.
- **Label-based site selection**: target any slice of your fleet with expressions like `-l environment=prod`, `-l country=US,city=Seattle`, or `-l name=munich-dev`
- **Subscription-scoped deployment**: deploy shared resources once per subscription, then deploy per-site resources with automatic output resolution
- **Output chaining**: reference outputs from previous steps, including cross-scope resolution from subscription to resource group deployments
- **Parallel execution**: deploy to multiple sites simultaneously with configurable concurrency
- **Failure isolation**: one site's failure doesn't block others. Subscription failures block only dependent sites.
- **Dry-run validation**: preview the full deployment plan without making Azure calls
- **Flexible step orchestration**: conditional execution, parameter auto-filtering, and mixed step types (Bicep and kubectl via Arc proxy) in a single manifest

### Cloud-first deployment

Site Ops deploys infrastructure through Azure Resource Manager, the native control plane for Azure resources. For Arc-enabled solutions like Azure IoT Operations, this aligns with Azure's cloud-first model: no in-cluster GitOps agents required.

---

## Prerequisites

Local tools:

- Python 3.10+
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed and authenticated
- For kubectl steps: `kubectl` in PATH

Azure resources (per target cluster):

- An Arc-connected Kubernetes cluster with **OIDC issuer** and **workload identity** enabled. See [Connect an existing Kubernetes cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster).
- **Cluster Connect** enabled (`az connectedk8s enable-features --features cluster-connect`).
- Subscription **Owner** principal (or `User Access Administrator` plus `Contributor`). AIO deploys make role assignments.

## Override for your subscription

Sites in `workspaces/iot-operations/sites/` ship with placeholder subscription IDs (each site inherits `subscription: "00000000-..."` from `shared/<region>.yaml`). You replace the placeholder via a `sites.local/` overlay (for local runs) or the `SITE_OVERRIDES` secret (for CI runs). Both paths below assume this is in place.

For a local override of `munich-dev`, create `workspaces/iot-operations/sites.local/munich-dev.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Site
name: munich-dev
subscription: "<your-subscription-id>"
```

`sites.local/` is gitignored. The overlay merges into `sites/munich-dev.yaml` at load time. The base `munich-dev.yaml` already has working `resourceGroup` and `parameters.clusterName` values. Override them here only if you want different values. Verify the resolved shape before deploying:

```bash
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations sites munich-dev --render
```

For CI, see [docs/ci-cd-setup.md](docs/ci-cd-setup.md) for the `SITE_OVERRIDES` JSON shape that replaces the local overlay.

## Quick start

### Option 1: Run locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Azure/digital-ops-scale-kit.git
cd digital-ops-scale-kit

# Install Site Ops
pip install -e .

# Authenticate with Azure
az login

# Discover sites in the shipped workspace
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations sites

# Validate, preview, deploy. After the `sites.local/<site>.yaml` overlay
# from "Override for your subscription" is in place, deploy against just
# that site:
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations validate manifests/aio-install.yaml
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations deploy manifests/aio-install.yaml -l name=munich-dev --dry-run
siteops -w workspaces/iot-operations deploy manifests/aio-install.yaml -l name=munich-dev
```

### Option 2: Use as a GitHub template

The local path above proves the tool works. To productionize as a CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Create your repository**:
   - Click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository**
   - Or fork the repository to your organization

2. **Configure GitHub secrets** for Azure OIDC authentication:

   | Secret | Description |
   |--------|-------------|
   | `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Azure AD application client ID |
   | `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD tenant ID |
   | `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Default subscription for login |

   See [docs/ci-cd-setup.md](docs/ci-cd-setup.md) for OIDC federation setup.

3. **Configure site overrides** (optional):

   The included sites use placeholder subscription IDs. To deploy to real Azure resources, create a `SITE_OVERRIDES` secret with your actual values. See [docs/ci-cd-setup.md](docs/ci-cd-setup.md#site-overrides) for the JSON shape.

4. **Configure environments** (optional):
   - Create `dev`, `staging`, `prod` environments in repository settings
   - Add approval policies for `staging` and `prod`

5. **Run a deployment**:
   - Go to **Actions** → **Deploy** → **Run workflow**
   - Select a manifest and environment
   - Monitor progress in the workflow logs

### Workspace anatomy

Each workspace follows a consistent structure:

| Directory | Purpose | Contains |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `sites/` | **Where** to deploy | Site definitions with subscription, resource group, labels |
| `manifests/` | **What** to deploy | Ordered steps with site selection and conditions |
| `parameters/` | **With what values** | Template variables, output chaining |
| `templates/` | **How** to deploy | Bicep/ARM templates |
| `sites.local/` | **Overrides** | Local/CI overrides (gitignored) |

---

## Core concepts

### Sites

A **site** is a deployment target. Define one per row in your fleet
under `workspaces/<workspace>/sites/`:

```yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Site
name: munich-dev
subscription: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
resourceGroup: rg-iot-munich-dev
location: germanywestcentral
labels:
  environment: dev
  city: Munich
parameters:
  clusterName: munich-dev-arc
```

Sites can inherit shared defaults from a `SiteTemplate`, get overlaid
by `sites.local/` files at runtime, and operate at either RG scope or
subscription scope. See [docs/site-configuration.md](docs/site-configuration.md)
for the full model.

### Manifests

A **manifest** is an ordered list of deployment steps targeted at one
or more sites:

```yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Manifest
name: aio-install
selector: "environment=dev"
steps:
  - name: schema-registry
    template: templates/deps/schema-registry.bicep
    scope: resourceGroup
  - name: aio-instance
    template: templates/aio/instance.bicep
    scope: resourceGroup
    parameters:
      - parameters/inputs/aio-instance.yaml  # outputs from prior steps
```

A manifest can also `include:` other manifests (partials and standalone
manifests) to compose larger pipelines. See
[docs/manifest-reference.md](docs/manifest-reference.md) for the full
step shape, conditions, and parallel options, and
[docs/manifest-includes.md](docs/manifest-includes.md) for the
composition contract.

### Template variables

Site values flow into parameter files via Mustache-style placeholders:

```yaml
# parameters/common/common.yaml (manifest-level, applies to every step)
location: "{{ site.location }}"
aioInstanceName: "{{ site.name }}-aio"
```

```yaml
# parameters/inputs/aio-instance.yaml (step-level chaining)
schemaRegistryId: "{{ steps.schema-registry.outputs.schemaRegistry.id }}"
```

See [docs/parameter-resolution.md](docs/parameter-resolution.md) for
auto-filtering, merge order, and cross-scope output chaining.

## Extending

### Create a new workspace

1. Create directory structure:

   ```
   workspaces/my-workspace/
   ├── sites/
   ├── manifests/
   ├── parameters/
   └── templates/
   ```

2. Add site definitions in `sites/`
3. Add or reference Bicep templates
4. Create manifests that orchestrate the deployment

### Add a new site

```yaml
# sites/seattle-prod.yaml
apiVersion: siteops/v1
kind: Site
name: seattle-prod
inherits: base-site.yaml  # Optional: inherit shared config

subscription: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
resourceGroup: rg-iot-seattle-prod
location: westus2

labels:
  environment: prod
  country: US
  city: Seattle

parameters:
  clusterName: seattle-prod-arc
```

Sites can live at any depth under `sites/`. Use `sites/regions/eu/munich.yaml` to group by region. Basenames must remain unique within the trusted directory tree. See [docs/targeting.md](docs/targeting.md) for the identity model.

### Add conditional steps

```yaml
steps:
  - name: optional-feature
    template: templates/feature.bicep
    scope: resourceGroup
    when: "{{ site.properties.featureOptions.enableFeature }}"
```
