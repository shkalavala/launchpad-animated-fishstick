## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Workspace** | A directory under `workspaces/` containing the standard subdirs (`sites/`, `manifests/`, `parameters/`, `templates/`) plus optional `samples/`, `sites.local/`. |
| **Site** | A deployment target (`kind: Site`). Has subscription, optional resource group, location, labels, parameters, properties. |
| **SiteTemplate** | A reusable site base (`kind: SiteTemplate`). Cannot be deployed directly. Referenced via `inherits:`. |
| **Manifest** | A `kind: Manifest` YAML defining ordered steps + parameters + a site selector. The unit of `siteops deploy`. |
| **Selector** | A label expression (`key=value,key=value`) that filters sites. Set on a manifest as `selector:` or via the CLI `--selector` / `-l` flag. See [targeting.md](targeting.md). |
| **Inheritance** | Single-parent merge for sites. A site `inherits:` from a SiteTemplate. Child overrides parent on conflict. Nested objects merge recursively. |
| **Overlay** | A same-name site file in `sites.local/` (or an extras dir) that merges into a base site at load time. Cannot introduce `inherits:` or rename the site. |
| **Include** | A step shape that splices another manifest's steps into the parent's step list at the include's position. Optionally gated by `when:`. |
| **Standalone manifest** | A manifest meant to be deployed directly. The default. |
| **Partial** | A manifest authored to be `include:`-d, not deployed standalone. Filename prefixed `_` by convention. |
| **Sample** | A deployable example in `samples/<name>/`. Two shapes are supported: bundles (manifest + partial + template + inputs) and compositions (a manifest that `include:`s leaf partials from `manifests/` and other samples). |
| **Composition** | A sample whose `manifest.yaml` is built entirely from `include:` steps that pull in `_partial.yaml`s from `manifests/` and other samples. Has no template of its own. |
| **Step** | A unit of work in a manifest's `steps:` list. Three shapes: Bicep deploy (`template:`), kubectl op (`type: kubectl`), include (`include:`). |
| **Scope** | A step's deployment scope: `resourceGroup` or `subscription`. |
| **AIO release** | A versioned bundle of pinned extension versions and API versions, defined by a YAML in `parameters/aio-releases/` and selected per site via `properties.aioRelease`. |
| **Auto-filtering** | The engine drops parameter keys that the target Bicep template does not declare. Enables shared parameter files across templates. |
| **Chaining** | Wiring a step's outputs into a downstream step's parameters via `{{ steps.X.outputs.Y }}`. |
| **Dispatcher** | A Bicep template that switches on an API-version param into per-API-version inner modules under `templates/<area>/modules/`. |
