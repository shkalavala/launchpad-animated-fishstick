        Resolution order:
        1. Relative to the child file's directory (default, locality-preserving).
        2. Narrow fallback: if the relative path does not exist AND
           `inherits_value` is a bare filename (no path separators), look for
           it in the workspace's `sites/` directory. This lets a site file
           in an extra trusted dir reference a workspace-owned template

           a new syntax. The fallback is intentionally limited to

           `sites.local/`, so there is no cross-extra-dir shared namespace
           and no way for an overlay to inject a new inheritance target.

        `inherits:` is author-trusted: the value comes from a trusted site
        file (workspace `sites/` or an operator-vouched extras dir), so the
        resolver deliberately does NOT sandbox the resolved path to a
        specific set of filesystem roots. The real control is who may
